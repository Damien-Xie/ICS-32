Software Engineering Best Practices

Guidelines to building software well

Single responsibility principle - A unit(i.e. functions, class, ...) should only have one reason to change / Seperation of Concerns
Open/close principle - A design must be open to extension and closed to modification

An exception is an object that is created & fired when an error occurs.
- If the exception is handled, the program runs n maybe gives error message
- If the exception is not handled, the program can crash

program paradigms(norms, mode):

1. Procedral Programming:
    call and return
    data is passed around from function to function as needed
    all about procedures

2. Object-Oriented Programming(OOP):
    All about the data
    No functions but rather methods
    methods are utilities to support data
    program with a data centric view -> define data entities and their interactions with each other
    all about the actual data and its relationship

3. Functional Programming (FP):
    functions being passed like data (arguments) instead of actual data
